# /moonview:cancel — Cancel Task Module

Cancel a task module, stopping any active auto loop and optionally cleaning up the git worktree.

## Usage

```
/moonview:cancel <task_module_path> [--reason "..."] [--cleanup]
```

## Arguments

- **task_module** (required): path to task module directory
- **--reason** (optional): cancellation reason, recorded in `.index.json` body
- **--cleanup** (optional): also remove the git worktree and delete the task branch

## Execution Steps

1. **Read** `.index.json` — get current status
2. **Stop auto** if running:
   - Call `GET /api/task-auto/lookup?taskDir=<task_module_path>` to find the session running this task's auto loop
   - If found (200): call `DELETE /api/sessions/<session_name>/task-auto`
   - If not found (404): no auto loop running, skip
   - Delete `.auto-signal` file if exists
   - Delete `.auto-stop` file if exists
   - Delete `.lock` file if exists — first read lock content and verify the holder: (a) if holder `pid` is dead → delete lock (stale); (b) if holder `session` matches the auto session being cancelled → delete lock (same session); (c) if held by a **different live session** → REJECT with error identifying the holding session — user must stop that session first or use `cancel` from the holding session. Cancel does NOT force-override locks held by other live sessions to prevent concurrent write corruption
3. **Acquire** `AiTasks/<module>/.lock` (see Concurrency Protection in `commands/ai-cli-task.md`). If lock is held by a different live session (not the auto session stopped in step 2), REJECT — user must stop that session first
4. **If uncommitted changes exist**, git commit snapshot: `ai-cli-task(<module>):cancel pre-cancel snapshot`
5. **Update** `.index.json`:
   - Set `status` to `cancelled`
   - Update `updated` timestamp
   - Append cancellation reason to body (if provided)
6. **Write** `.summary.md` with condensed context: current status, cancellation reason, progress at time of cancellation (`completed_steps`), any known issues
7. **Git commit**: `ai-cli-task(<module>):cancel user cancelled`
8. **Release** `AiTasks/<module>/.lock`
9. **If `--cleanup`**:
   - Remove worktree: `git worktree remove .worktrees/task-<module>`
   - Delete branch: `git branch -d task/<module>` (safe delete — warns if unmerged). If `-d` fails because branch has unmerged work, report warning to user with the unmerged commit count. User can explicitly re-run with `git branch -D` if they want to force-delete
10. **Report** cancellation result

## State Transitions

Any non-terminal status → `cancelled`. Terminal statuses (`complete`, `cancelled`) → REJECT.

## Notes

- Cancel is rejected on terminal statuses: `complete` (use a separate workflow to reopen) and `cancelled` (already terminal)
- If the task has uncommitted code changes in a worktree, `--cleanup` will warn before deleting
- Without `--cleanup`, the branch and worktree are preserved for reference
- A cancelled task can be referenced by `report` for documentation purposes
- **Concurrency**: Cancel acquires `AiTasks/<module>/.lock` before modifying files and releases on completion (see Concurrency Protection in `commands/ai-cli-task.md`). Lock cleanup for the auto session (step 2) is separate from cancel's own lock acquisition (step 3)
