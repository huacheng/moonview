# Seed Type Registry

Predefined task types used to initialize `AiTasks/.type-registry.md`. Each type has a dedicated file containing Phase Intelligence (plan/verify/check/exec methodology). `research` auto-expands the registry by discovering new types from `.target.md` + web research.

> **This directory is for human maintenance.** When new domain types are commonly needed, add a file here. The runtime registry (`AiTasks/.type-registry.md`) grows automatically via `research` — these seed files only affect initial registry creation and first-time shared profile bootstrapping.

## Type Index

| [dsp.md](dsp.md) | `dsp` | Digital signal processing, audio, frequency analysis | SNR, THD, spectral analysis, listening tests |
| [data-pipeline.md](data-pipeline.md) | `data-pipeline` | Data transformation, ETL, migration | Schema validation, row counts, data integrity |
| [infrastructure.md](infrastructure.md) | `infrastructure` | DevOps, deployment, CI/CD, containers | Health checks, smoke tests, rollback verification |
| [documentation.md](documentation.md) | `documentation` | Docs, README, translation, content | Prose linting, link validation, reading level |
| [ml.md](ml.md) | `ml` | Machine learning, model training, datasets | Accuracy/F1, cross-validation, data split integrity |
| [literary.md](literary.md) | `literary` | Fiction, poetry, creative writing, essays | Style analysis, consistency checks, readability |
| [screenwriting.md](screenwriting.md) | `screenwriting` | Film/TV scripts, storyboards, dialogue | Format compliance, scene structure, dialogue flow |
| [science.md](science.md) | `science:*` | Physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, math, economics | Reproducibility, statistical significance, peer methodology |
| [mechatronics.md](mechatronics.md) | `mechatronics` | Embedded systems, robotics, PLC, control systems | Hardware-in-loop, timing analysis, safety interlocks |
| [ai-skill.md](ai-skill.md) | `ai-skill` | AI skill/plugin/agent/prompt development | Prompt testing, edge cases, context window efficiency |

## Naming Conventions

- Lowercase kebab-case: `data-pipeline`, `image-processing`
- Science subtypes use colon separator following [arXiv taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy): `science:physics`, `science:neuro`
- Custom types discovered by research follow the same conventions

## How This Directory Is Used

1. **`init`** reads `.summary.md` when creating `AiTasks/.type-registry.md` for the first time (if registry doesn't exist)
2. **`research`** reads per-type files (e.g., `software.md`) as fallback seed data when no shared profile exists in `AiTasks/.type-profiles/`
3. New types discovered by `research` are appended to the runtime registry, NOT this directory
4. Maintainers update this directory to add commonly needed seed types for new projects

## Collection Priority by Phase

| Phase | Priority Order |
|-------|---------------|
| plan | 1. Architecture/design patterns → 2. Dependency/compatibility info → 3. Trade-off analysis → 4. Prior art |
| verify | 1. Testing frameworks/tools → 2. Pass/fail criteria standards → 3. Coverage measurement → 4. Regression strategies |
| check | 1. Industry quality standards → 2. Acceptance benchmarks → 3. Compliance requirements → 4. Peer evaluation criteria |
| exec | 1. API/tool reference docs → 2. Implementation recipes → 3. Debugging techniques → 4. Performance optimization |

## Requirements

1. **Phase-aware collection**: Always check the `--caller` parameter to focus research on the calling phase's needs
2. **Domain-appropriate sources**: Prioritize official documentation, standards bodies, and established references
3. **Actionable output**: Each reference file must contain concrete, usable information — not abstract overviews
4. **Freshness**: When tools have multiple versions, research the version actually used in the project
5. **Gap-aware**: During `--scope gap`, compare existing `.references/` content against the calling phase's needs
